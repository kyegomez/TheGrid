"""
An interface for exchanging internal "BLOOM points" for higher priority compute requests. NOT IMPLEMENTED.
The intent is to let Grid participants earn points by helping others while idle (e.g. at night), then use these
 points to run their own compute experiments faster. See Section 4 of https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01188 for discussion.
